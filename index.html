                                            As a Software Architect, I was responsible for designing the architectures and data models for the company's new products.
                                            I assisted the teams in developing the features.
                                            Meanwhile, I had the opportunity to familiarize myself with and implement cutting-edge technologies in the company.
                                            I transitioned the development process from the old-fashioned silo approach to a modern Spotify method-based, feature team-based system.
                                            I designed and implemented the Company Development Guidelines, processes, and workflows.
                                            I supported the teams in various ways, including providing technical advice, planning internal trainings, expanding the professional knowledge base, conducting interviews, and more.

                                            New Product Development:
                                            As a Software Architect, I designed the architecture for one of the company's main products and led a team that implemented it over the last three years.
                                            After that, I participated in the design of the latest product.

                                        <span>
                                            I believe the main challenges were based on two factors: the business needs and the team’s capabilities.
                                            The system works with large amounts of telematic data, which we had to process in many different ways in near real time.
                                            Additionally, we had to deliver the main functionality in a very short period of time (around 8 months) with a small team.
                                            Therefore, when designing the architecture, I had to consider the knowledge and limits of the team and decide which technologies to use.

                                            The software was a large monolith, incorporating almost all the technologies from the past 20 years. We performed bug fixes and small developments based on the requirements.

                                            We had to change the builds as Microsoft no longer supported XAML builds.
                                            For this reason, we sliced the large monolith into microservices.
                                            My team worked on figuring out the new CI/CD system and how to start slicing the monolith into smaller deployable services.
